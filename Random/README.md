# Random Challenges
The repsitory contains the problems related to Random algorithms I have tried to solve on the leetcode [website](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)

### Random Pick With Blacklist
The goal is create a Uniformly distributed number generator that takes into account a blacklist of number. The solution should use as less call to rand() as possible.  
I tried to solve this problem using the C++, C, Rust and Python languages. [Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-blacklist/)
